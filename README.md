# Agentic Gaming Banner Set

A cinematic single-page showcase of four ultra-wide 14K (14,000 × 1,450 px) anime-inspired gaming banners. Each composition highlights Obito, Naruto, Madara, and Kakashi with metallic lettering, ember swirls, and lightning-charged atmospherics suited for a high-energy gaming channel brand.

## Preview Locally

1. Serve the static files from the project root:
   ```bash
   npx serve .
   ```
2. Open `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown in your terminal).

The banners render with a scaled preview by default. Use the “Toggle Full Resolution Preview” control to view them at a higher scale.

## Deploy

Deploy the static site directly to Vercel:

```bash
vercel deploy --prod --yes --token $VERCEL_TOKEN --name agentic-38fd4f18
```

## Files

- `index.html` – Page structure and banner markup.
- `styles.css` – Layered gradients, ember effects, and lightning animations.
- `script.js` – Preview scaling toggle.

Feel free to customize gradients, typography, or copy to match your brand.
